Hi,

This project done in ANGULARJS V-1.6 Done

to run the project we have to run the project we need a server like self hosting or anything (http-server)

just run toppingPizzas2.html 

Values are not taken from the pizzas.json ,because its taking long run for pick-up the datas from the file.

instead i have inserted the datas in the inline file.

Thanks
